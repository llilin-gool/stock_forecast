The environmental pollution is worse and worse today. Many trees are cutdown, and water and air are polluted. As a student I try to have a low-carbonlife to save energy and reduce pollution.Firstly, I often walk to school. It can reduce air pollution. Secondly, Ialways turn off the lights and fans when leaving the classroom. Thirdly, Ialways make full use of paper and other school things and never waste water. I wish more students to join me and make the earth more and morebeautiful.
